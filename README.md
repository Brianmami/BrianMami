Welcome to my GitHub account! I am a Computer Engineer at Toronto Metropolitan University currently in my third year pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering. I love to work with technology, learn new things, and continue to grow as a coder, engineer, and person. In my GitHub, you will find many different projects and assignements I have completed for school, personal use, and tournaments.
